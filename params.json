{"name":"Django-Narcissus","body":"This project aims to provide an easily usable blog engine for Django with a\r\nbuilt-in dashboard based on Backbone.js and Twitter Bootstrap to make it very\r\neasy for users to create entries and for developers to customize the\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nIt is also intended to be a fully fleshed-out example of how to\r\ndeeply integrate Backbone.js with a Django application. I plan on recording a\r\ncouple of screencasts walking developers through the integration.\r\n\r\nA long-term goal is to make Narcissus easy to install and use for a non-\r\ndeveloper, finding ways to make Django apps more accessible for users that are\r\nonly moderately technical.\r\n\r\nThe Bootstrap styles will stay default for the first couple of releases, and\r\nthen I'll focus on some customization to give Narcissus a unique and\r\nattractive dashboard interface.\r\n\r\n# Interface Examples\r\n\r\n## Status Updates\r\n\r\n![Status Update](http://f.cl.ly/items/1R25330r3X042m1L1q3Y/status-update.png)\r\n\r\n## Articles\r\n\r\n![Articles](http://f.cl.ly/items/2E0s3O3A2F1O1z0n2i1f/article.png)\r\n","tagline":"(coming soon) A blogging app with a built-in dashboard based on Backbone.js and Bootstrap that helps you easily share status updates, images, links, and long-form articles on your personal website.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
