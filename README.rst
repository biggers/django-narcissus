Interface Examples
==================

This project aims to provide an easily usable blog engine for Django with a
built-in dashboard based on Backbone.js and Twitter Bootstrap to make it very
easy for users to create entries and for developers to customize the
experience. It is also intended to be a fully fleshed-out example of how to
deeply integrate Backbone.js with a Django application.

The Bootstrap styles will stay default for the first couple of releases, and
then I'll focus on some customization to give Narcissus a unique and
attractive dashboard interface.
