Django-Narcissus
================

*Note: This project is currently inactive. In it's current form, it has too
much magic and is over-complex.*

This project aims to provide an easily usable blog engine for Django with a
built-in dashboard based on Backbone.js and Twitter Bootstrap to make it very
easy for users to create entries and for developers to customize the
experience.

It is also intended to be a fully fleshed-out example of how to
deeply integrate Backbone.js with a Django application. I plan on recording a
couple of screencasts walking developers through the integration.

A long-term goal is to make Narcissus easy to install and use for a non-
developer, finding ways to make Django apps more accessible for users that are
only moderately technical.

The Bootstrap styles will stay default for the first couple of releases, and
then I'll focus on some customization to give Narcissus a unique and
attractive dashboard interface.
